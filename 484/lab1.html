				<p class="PText">
					Every friday after the web engineering class at 16:00, I go to play soccer
					in front of the Live Oak building with a couple of friends. Lately more and
					more people have been joining our casual games. On this day in particular,
					one of the regulars slid on me and got my leg. He somehow was able to step
					on my leg whilst sliding and it caused some of the bones in my foot to break.
					I had to get out of the game because of the pain and to this day I have not 
					gotten it fixed since the doctor said there wasn't much he could do other 
					than put a cast.

				<h2><span><time>12/25/15</time></span>: Skateboarding at Skidrow </h2> 
				<p class="PText">
					On Christmas day, I went with some friends to skidrow in downtown Los Angeles.
					We went to grab a drink in a new brewery that had just opened up in that area.
					Once we got the brewery, we started trying different kind of beers with flights
					that were provided free of charge. After the place closed, we went to grab some 
					skateboards from my buddies loft and ended up skating through skidrow. Since I
					live around there I see the horrid sight fairly often, but it never feels any
					better passing by in the dark of night. We ended up almost getting into a fight,
					but we ended up breaking it up and leaving so that we wouldn't get arrested.`
